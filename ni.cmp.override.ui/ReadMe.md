This plugin provides a custom form to display some special accounting information.

My decision was to create a custom form to have the full control over the functionality

and to extend the functionality step by step.


** Installation **

1. Install the plug-in with your osgi console

defined date range. The beginning balance is on the first line showed. The 

ending balance is on the last Account posting line.

Displays a overview to all accounts from the COA with the current balance.

A date range can be defined in different kinds.

** SummaryAccountDocument **
In the most cases each product generate a separate factline. If you

have 100 positions in your invoice as example, then the view of the 

accounting for a document can be a little bit confusing. This view 

show the posting as summary per account.

time range. Also the balance before defined the time range and the ending balance.
*Can be time critical if there are many data!*

per year, month and day.
*Can be time critical if there are many data!*


** Export as html **
Export the result as a html-file. To print the results as example or to store the results.

Export the result as a txt-file, tab as delimiter and linebreak with \n.

So it is possible to import the file or copy and paste the information in your 

favorite spreadsheet program.


**Zoom**
In the accountview it is now possible to zoom to the document of the selected

fact_acct.
